    Problem Statement
When he's not busy fighting with Dr. Robotnik, Sonic makes a living delivering submarine sandwiches via an empty subway tunnel.
The tunnel goes past N stations, numbered from 1 to N.
Station i is located i miles away from Sonic, who plans to run from one end of the tunnel to the other, tossing a sandwich to an awaiting customer at every station.

At each station, a customer is scheduled to meet Sonic within an expected delivery window.
Sonic can deliver a sandwich to station i only if he arrives within the inclusive interval [A_i, B_i] seconds.

Chasing Dr. Robotnik is tiring enough, so Sonic doesn't want to exert himself more than he has to.
If he runs at a constant speed, whatâ€™s the minimum speed, in miles per second, that will allow him to deliver to every station?
If no such constant speed exists, output -1.

Your answer will be accepted if it is within an absolute or relative error of 10^-6 (even if the expected answer is -1).

    Constraints
- 1 <= T <= 95
- 1 <= N <= 1,000,000
- 0 <= A_i < B_i <= 1,000,000
The sum of N across all test cases is at most 5,000,000.
    Input Format
Input begins with an integer T, the number of test cases.
Each case starts with a line containing the integer N.
Then, N lines follow, the i-th of which contains the integers A_i and B_i.
    Output Format
For the i-th test case, print "Case #i: "
followed by the minimum constant speed, in miles per second,
that Sonic can run that will get him to each door while it's open,
or -1 if no such constant speed exists.
